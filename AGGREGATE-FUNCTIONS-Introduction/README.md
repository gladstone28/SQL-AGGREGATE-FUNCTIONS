AGGREGATE FUNCTIONS
Introduction
3 min
SQL Queries don’t just access raw data, they can also perform calculations on the raw data to answer specific data questions.

Calculations performed on multiple rows of a table are called aggregates.

In this lesson, we have given you a table named fake_apps which is made up of fake mobile applications data.

Here is a quick preview of some important aggregates that we will cover in the next five exercises:

COUNT(): count the number of rows
SUM(): the sum of the values in a column
MAX()/MIN(): the largest/smallest value
AVG(): the average of the values in a column
ROUND(): round the values in the column
Let’s get started!
