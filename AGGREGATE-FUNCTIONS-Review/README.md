### AGGREGATE FUNCTIONS

## Review



Congratulations!

You just learned how to use aggregate functions to perform calculations on your data. What can we generalize so far?

- COUNT(): count the number of rows
- SUM(): the sum of the values in a column
- MAX()/MIN(): the largest/smallest value
- AVG(): the average of the values in a column
- ROUND(): round the values in the column
Aggregate functions combine multiple rows together to form a single value of more meaningful information.

- GROUP BY is a clause used with aggregate functions to combine data from one or more columns.
- HAVING limit the results of a query based on an aggregate property.

### Instructions
Feel free to experiment a bit more with the fake_apps table before moving on!
